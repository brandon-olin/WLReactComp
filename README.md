### Project Notes

I built this project using a few packages, including:
* Material UI: for quick component building and styling, as well as different icons used throughout the app
* node-sass: to use SCSS in the project to keep my stylesheets a bit more organized
* react-router-dom: for basic routing/navigation
* validator: to check validity of emails from user input

I decided to attempt to replicate the comp as closely as possible, with a few changes to the contact form style based on the components available in Material UI.

I also changed some things stylistically and made the drone hero image on the home page fit within the bounds of a mobile screen, which it didn't in the comp. I thought it looked a bit nicer this way, but in a production scenario I'd be willing to adjust things based on input from the client or UX designer.

I used SCSS as a preprocessor as it's what I learned in my bootcamp, and it's the simplest and most straightforward preprocessor I've worked with. That said, I'd be willing to learn a new preprocessor if White Label has one they prefer.

I believe that covers everything. I tried to make my code as straightforward and easy to understand as possible, while commenting on the things that might not have been as clear. But if anything isn't clear I'm interested to hear any feedback you have for me!
